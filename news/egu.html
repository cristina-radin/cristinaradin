I presented this work at the General Assembly of the European Geosciences Union (EGU 2024), where I shared our research on identifying regional climate variability patterns from global subsurface ocean temperature data using a multi-layer machine learning framework. The study, later published in Earth Systems and Environment by Springer Nature, explores how artificial intelligence can uncover large-scale oceanic structures and improve our understanding of climate dynamics.
